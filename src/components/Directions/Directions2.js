            Gaming is obviously entertaining, but is it still fun with lagging
            in the middle of gamplay? No! Losing games because of the lag is a
            nightmare to all gamers. To defeat lag and reclaim the Internet for
            our gamers, this is how Booster do it:{" "}

                  Our first step is just way too simple! Just completely ignore
                  how existing lag-reducing product worked. None of them worked
                  that well anyways. This is how Boosted Booster is!

                  Second stop is a bit tricky. Booster is fundamentally
                  different than any other type of network solution, we gotta
                  build a custom network infrastructure manually with private
                  fiber optic networks and servers.
